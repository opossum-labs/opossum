`light data`
: Definition of the light field of the source. See [here](../light_data.md) for more details.

`light data iso`
: Isometry of the light data field. By defining this isometry it is possible to move a point source with respect to the anchor point of the source.

`alignment wavelength`
: This property defines the wavelength if the single light ray which is used during alignment of the nodes.
