# Subsystems and Components

Modern laser systems are composed of a large number of optical subsystems and individual optical components. For a holistic description of such a system, all these optical components and the structures that are built from these must be modeled. Furthermore, a numerous amount of physical effects/processes must be included to create a realistic view of the full system.

In the following, a, probably not complete, list of relevant effects/processes, subsystems and components for high-intensity lasers will be compiled. 

## Physical Effects/Processes
### Second-order nonlinear effects
Second-order nonlinear effects include all processes that result from the response of the second-order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$:
* Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG)
* Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG)
* Difference-Frequency Generation (DFG)
* Optical Rectification (OR)
* Optical Parametric Amplification (OPA)
